# Project Description:

This project focuses on deploying and managing servers on Linux operating systems. It includes setting up an HTTP server on CentOS and deploying basic HTML templates, as well as configuring a LAMP stack on Ubuntu and deploying a WordPress template. The deployment process will be automated using Vagrant provisioning.
